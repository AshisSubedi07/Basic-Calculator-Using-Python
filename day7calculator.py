#A simple python program which can do all the arithmetic opecation on real numbers.
a=input("Enter first number")
b=input("Enter second number")
print("The addition is: ",int(a)+int(b))  #addition
print("The addition is: ",int(a)-int(b))  #Substraction
print("The addition is: ",int(a)*int(b))  #multiplication
print("The addition is: ",int(a)/int(b))  #Division
print("The addition is: ",int(a)%int(b))  #Modulas
